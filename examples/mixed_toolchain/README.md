## Mixed Toolchain

How is it possible that we can build two separate relocatable files,
using two different compiler toolchains, that can communicate easily
between one another?

The calling procedure (defined in the application binary interface --
the ABI) is how!

Try compiling the code included here to see the details behind the
scenes. It's fascinating!

### Building

`make`

### Results

1. .c files: The C source code. `main.cpp` uses a function named `sum`
that is defined in the `sum.c` file. 
2. .S files: These files contain the assembly code generated by the 
compiler for the corresponding .c files. You can look at the generated
assembly code and see how they work together!
3. .o files: `sum.c` is compiled to `sum.o` using `clang`. `main.c` is
compiled to `main.o` by `gcc`.
4. sum: The executable binary is linked together from the `.o` files
using `gcc.
