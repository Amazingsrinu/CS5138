## Hello, ASM

A simple Hello, World! program written in nothing but ASM.

### Compiling

```
make
```

There is a rule for generating `hello.obj` -- output from objdump for `hello.out`. The
contents of the file are interesting to review for comparison with hello.asm.

### Running

```
$ ./hello.out
```

### Expected Result

```
Hello, ASM
```
